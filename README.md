<b>Week 4</b>
</br>
Meeting notes: Discussed the third milestone and divided into teams for the next week. Each team will work on different features and we will integrate those features next week. The group decided on using [javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) as our standard documentation tool. For theme we will implement color options. Each sub-team will meet and divide up their work and have their components ready for integration by next **Wed (10/26)**. At that point we will start integregation those seperate components together.
