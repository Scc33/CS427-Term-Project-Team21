<b>Week 4</b>
</br>
Meeting notes: Discussed the third milestone and divided into teams for the next week. Each team will work on different features and we will integrate those features next week. The group decided on using [javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) as our standard documentation tool. For theme we will implement color options. Each sub-team will meet and divide up their work and have their components ready for integration by next **Wed (10/26)**. At that point we will start integregation those seperate components together.

<b>Week 5</b>
</br>
Meeting notes: We went over the current progress with signing in and the UI screen. Currently we can add/remove/save cities as well as create new accounts. We can also select themes and there has been work done on logout buttons and showing the user their username.
We discussed technical strategy for how we will save data and structure where the theme will go. Remaining tasks are as follows:
1. Documentation (Deeya)
2. Saving cities specific to user (Sean/Abram)
3. Moving theme button selection to the sign in page (button will be highlighted for currently selected theme) (Junming/Kedar)
4. Need to save theme to be permanent (Sean/Vikram/Abram)  
5. Logout button on the main activity (Zehua)
6. Show the username on the main activity (This is working - please merge this branch to main)
7. Final video
</br>
Please have all code done by Saturday so that the video can be filmed and submitted on Sunday.
